    <h1>Sexually Transmitted Diseases(STDs)</h1>
    <p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are generally acquired by sexual
      contact.
      The organisms (bacteria, viruses or parasites) that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to
      person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids.
      Sometimes these infections can be transmitted nonsexually, such as from mother to infant during pregnancy or
      childbirth, or through blood transfusions or shared needles.
      STDs don't always cause symptoms. It's possible to contract sexually transmitted diseases from people who seem
      perfectly healthy and may not even know they have an infection.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can have a range of signs and
      symptoms, including no symptoms.
      That's why they may go unnoticed until complications occur or a partner is diagnosed.</p>
    <p>NB:Signs and symptoms may appear a few days after exposure, or it may take years before you have any noticeable
      problems, depending on the organism.</p>
    <p>Signs and symptoms that might indicate an STD/STI include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area</li>
      <li>Painful or burning urination</li>
      <li>Discharge from the penis or vagina</li>
      <li>Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread</li>
      <li>Unusual or odd-smelling vaginal discharge</li>
      <li>Pain during sex</li>
      <li>Lower abdominal pain</li>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Rash over the trunk, hands or feet</li>
    </ul>
